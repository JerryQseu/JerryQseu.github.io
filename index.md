## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Southeast University, Nanjing. I am co-advised by Prof. [Guanyu Yang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0103/c23024a257233/page.htm), Prof. Shuo Li, and Prof. Yueming Jin.


Nanjing, where I work on Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Medical image analysis, Computer-assisted Intelligent Surgery, Computer-assisted Intelligent Diagnosis, etc. 



Prior to this, I achieved master’s degree at Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology. 

My research lies at the intersection of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Medicine – with a special focus on  
with a special focus on dealing with the tough task in tubular structure analysis that are knowledge-driven and data-efficient. My research interests include medical imaging, weakly-supervised learning, network design, federated learning, foundation model, and computer-assisted diagnosis, etc.

## Research Interests
