## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Southeast University, Nanjing. I am co-advised by Prof. [Guanyu Yang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0103/c23024a257233/page.htm), Prof. [Shuo Li](http://digitalimaginggroup.ca/members/shuo.php), and Prof. [Yueming Jin](https://yuemingjin.github.io/). Prior to this, I achieved master’s degree at Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology. 

My research lies at the intersection of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Medicine – with a special focus on dealing with the tough task in cardiac structure analysis that are prior-driven and motion-realted. My research interests include **medical imaging, federated learning, semi-supervised learning, contrastive learning, foundation model, and Computer-assisted Intelligent Diagnosis, etc.**
